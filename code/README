The code has been tested to work with [Racket](http://download.racket-lang.org/) 6.0.1.

Usage:

To translate custom XML descriptions to Intermine's XML descriptions:

> racket run-translate.rkt [desc1.xml] [desc2.xml] ...

Translation will create `desc.xml.out` for each `desc.xml`

To load database with description `desc.xml` from data files `data1.txt`, `data2.txt`, etc. and run query `query.xml`:

> racket run-query <desc.xml> <query.xml> [data1.txt] [data2.txt] ...
